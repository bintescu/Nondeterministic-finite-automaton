# Nondeterministic-finite-automaton
Recursive Implementation of NFAs using Python.

You need to use a txt file that specifies the language recognized by the automaton.
Format of the input.txt file :
First line is not use (for description only).
Second line = number of symbols in the alphabet.
Third line = each symbol of the alphabet separated by space
Fourth line = initial state
Fifth line = final states
Sixth line = no of transitions
All the line down represents transitions.
